If you only have one kitchen knife, make it a chef’s knife. 
No kitchen tool is more emblematic of a professional kitchen than a chef’s knife. Also known as a cook’s knife or French knife, a chef’s knife is hands-down the most all-purpose knife. 
It’s suited for everything from chopping through chicken bones to disjointing large cuts of beef. And mincing or slicing vegetables.
These broad, heavy knives measure 6-12” long. But, for the best combination of usability and utility, I’d recommend an 8” blade.


The second type of the knife is
Paring Knife

A paring knife is built for small, delicate, and intricate work. 
Paring knives range from 2.5” to 4” long. They’re lightweight, highly maneuverable, and incredibly affordable. 
It’s the perfect partner for a chef’s knife because the shorter blade won’t feel as clumsy (or dangerous) for detailed tasks. Think peeling fruits or deseeding and deveining a hot pepper.
This knife will also be useful if you don’t want to break out a full cutting board setup, like cutting pieces of fruit to top a salad.Expect to pay $20-100 for a quality paring knife. The Wusthof Classic is our all-around favorite.
