If you only have one kitchen knife, make it a chef’s knife. 
No kitchen tool is more emblematic of a professional kitchen than a chef’s knife. Also known as a cook’s knife or French knife, a chef’s knife is hands-down the most all-purpose knife. 
It’s suited for everything from chopping through chicken bones to disjointing large cuts of beef. And mincing or slicing vegetables.
These broad, heavy knives measure 6-12” long. But, for the best combination of usability and utility, I’d recommend an 8” blade.
