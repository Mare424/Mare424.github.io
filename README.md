Chef's Knife

If you only have one kitchen knife, make it a chef’s knife. 
No kitchen tool is more emblematic of a professional kitchen than a chef’s knife. Also known as a cook’s knife or French knife, a chef’s knife is hands-down the most all-purpose knife. 
It’s suited for everything from chopping through chicken bones to disjointing large cuts of beef. And mincing or slicing vegetables.
These broad, heavy knives measure 6-12” long. But, for the best combination of usability and utility, I’d recommend an 8” blade.


The second type of the knife is
Paring Knife

A paring knife is built for small, delicate, and intricate work. 
Paring knives range from 2.5” to 4” long. They’re lightweight, highly maneuverable, and incredibly affordable. 
It’s the perfect partner for a chef’s knife because the shorter blade won’t feel as clumsy (or dangerous) for detailed tasks. Think peeling fruits or deseeding and deveining a hot pepper.
This knife will also be useful if you don’t want to break out a full cutting board setup, like cutting pieces of fruit to top a salad.Expect to pay $20-100 for a quality paring knife. The Wusthof Classic is our all-around favorite.

The third type of the knife is
Utility Knife

The utility knife is a jack of all trades and master of none.
They lack the chopping power of the larger and heavier chef’s knife and can’t perform tasks quite as delicately as a paring knife. 
If you’re a minimalist, you may appreciate a utility knife’s do-everything size, shape, and construction. They’re great starter blades that cost significantly less than a chef knife.Most options are sized between 4-7”, and I would consider 6” to be the sweet spot for this type of knife. We recommend the 6” Henckels Classic.



The fourth type of the knife is
Bread Knife

The serrated edge of a bread knife makes it perfect for slicing crusty bread without crushing it. It will also work wonders on tomatoes, fruits, tough vegetables, and holiday roasts.
If you’ve taken up a bread-baking hobby, this is a “must-have” knife. There is no substitute. But the truth is not every kitchen needs one. 
Most options measure 6-10” long. The serrated edges make them a real bear to sharpen. And it’s probably not worth spending much on a bread knife that only gets used occasionally.Still, even an inexpensive knife like the OXO Good Grips bread knife will keep an edge for up to a year if you’re only using it to cut bread.



The last type of the knife is
Cleaver

A cleaver is the cutting tool of choice for butchery.
Buying and breaking down larger pieces of meat is a great way to save money, but it isn’t for everyone. You don’t need this knife if butchery isn’t in your plans
Cleavers are large, rectangular, and heavy. They’re designed to cut through bone. The thick blade adds weight and heft, which makes strong cuts easier on the hands and wrists.
The curvature of a cleaver’s blade can vary widely based on where that knife was made. For example, 
Most Chinese-style cleavers feature an almost entirely straight blade. 
A German cleaver features a more exaggerated curve.
